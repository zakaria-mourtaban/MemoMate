<!-- project philosophy -->
<img src="./readme/title2.svg"/>

> A Web app that streamlines the note-taking and summerization process, powered by AI.
>
> Memo Mate aims to take the organization, review, formatting and delivery load off of the hands of the user. Memo Mate removes the need for the user to manually assess each part of their notes without having to worry about the debt they left for their future selves to tackle. We believe that each QOL improvment we can deliver to the user, the more accessible notes will be for everyone.

### User Stories
- As an issuer, you will have the ability to issue bots with a provided set of knowledge(your notes) that will help you through whatever you need from these notes
- As a User, you will have the ability to create your own notes and you will be allowed to access chat bots by links that the issuer will share with you
- As an Admin, you will have the ability to see the sites performance, the tokens used by the userbase, and general statistical metrics

###  Memo Mate is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as the runtime, offering fast JavaScript and TypeScript execution for server-side applications.  
- The frontend is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), a popular library for building interactive user interfaces.  
- For styling, the app uses the ["Poppins"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) font to ensure a modern and clean design.  
- The app integrates [LangChain](https://langchain.com/) a composable framework to build with LLMs.

> We designed Memo Mate using wireframes and mockups, iterating on the design until we reached the ideal layout for easy navigation and a seamless user experience.
